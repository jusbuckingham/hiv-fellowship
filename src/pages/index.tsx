              More than 1.2 million people are living with HIV in the U.S. with more than 35,000 new infections each year.
              After 40 years, the HIV epidemic continues to devastate our communities, disproportionately impacting vulnerable populations.

              The HIV Clinical Leadership Program is an established, postdoctoral fellowship aimed at developing HIV specialists who are knowledgeable
              and committed to addressing the health inequities our patients face at an individual and systemic level. We have a proven track record
              of placing fellows in competitive leadership career positions throughout the United States.

                  Over 20-year track record of clinical excellence in HIV specialty fellowship training. Fellows train at the high-volume outpatient HIV
                  clinics of LA General Medical Center with experienced Family Medicine and Infectious Disease trained faculty. They rotate in community-based
                  HIV clinics, correctional settings and the inpatient Infectious Disease service, learning HIV primary and specialty care as well as the
                  management of complications, co-morbidities and co-infections associated with HIV. Additional training in Addiction Medicine and Gender
                  Affirming Care is incorporated into the curriculum to meet the needs of our diverse patient population and prepare fellows to provide
                  excellence in standard of care practices.
